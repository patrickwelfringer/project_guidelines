# Project guidelines

This is a set of guidelines for Code Club projects. Code Club is a network of volunteer-led after-school coding clubs for children.

## Format

- Introductory projects should take less than an hour to build something
- Each activity should be broken down into steps, each with checklists
- There should be both suggestions and challenges as well as the normal work

## Style

- Projects should be seperated by ability, not by age
- We shouldn't have gendered projects.
- We should reinforce the idea that coding is an ability, not a gift. It comes from working, not from talent.
- Each project should be suitable for all learners, including those with learning disabilities or special needs.
- We shouldn't have any exclusionary language, including racist, sexist, or homophobic language. 

## Language

- Avoid slang, as well as technical jargon.
- It is useful to introduce *some* technical jargon though.

## Requirements and preparation

- Setup and preparation should be minimal per project
- Minimal installation and software dependencies
- Avoid per project resources if possible

## Pedagogy

- Introduce one idea at a time, perferably one per project
- Repeat these ideas in subsequent projects, but with less detail and explanation
- Provide plenty of points for experimentation and exploration in the projects.
- Suggestions are of the form "Try changing X to see what happens"
- Challenges are "What would you have to change to get X to happen" or similar
- Suggestions generally come at the end of a step within a project
- Challenges generally come at the end of a project
